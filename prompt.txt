AI Coding Agent Prompt: Functional Specification for an ESG Onboarding and Data Collection Application Overall Goal Your task is to build the complete backend and frontend functionality for a comprehensive ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) onboarding and data collection application. The application is designed for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the hospitality sector. This prompt outlines the required functionality, the complete user journey, and the full database schema. You must implement all the logic described herein. Do not focus on visual design, styling, or specific technology stack choices; the priority is to deliver the core functionality. The User Journey: A Step-by-Step Functional Flow The user's journey is divided into six sequential modules. The completion of one module unlocks the next, but the user can navigate back to previously completed modules at any time using a side menu. Module 1: Company Onboarding Initial Data Entry: The user starts by providing their company's basic details: Emirate: A dropdown list of UAE Emirates. Sector: A dropdown list where "Hospitality" is the focus. Business Activities Selection: The system displays a list of predefined business activities relevant to the hospitality sector (e.g., Spa, Restaurants, Pools, Gym). The user can select multiple activities via checkboxes. A "Select All / Deselect All" button must be present to toggle all activity checkboxes at once. Custom Activities: An input field allows the user to add a new activity that is not on the list. Upon submission, this new activity is added to the database and becomes available for future companies. The newly added activity is automatically selected for the current company. Module 2: Framework Selection Automatic Framework Assignment: Based on the data from Module 1, the system automatically assigns mandatory frameworks. Core Framework: "ESG" is mandatory for all users. Conditional Frameworks: Geographic or sector-specific frameworks are automatically added if their conditions are met (e.g., "DST" is assigned if the user selected "Dubai" as their Emirate). Voluntary Framework Selection: The user is presented with a list of optional, voluntary frameworks (e.g., "Green Key"). They can opt-in by selecting them. Module 3: Personalized Data Checklist & Profiling Wizard Profiling Wizard Presentation: The system first presents the user with a series of plain-English, yes/no profiling questions. The list of questions is dynamically generated based on the mandatory and voluntary frameworks selected in Module 2. A "Answer All Yes / Answer All No" button must be provided to answer all questions at once. Checklist Generation: The final, streamlined checklist of data elements is hidden until the user has answered all of the profiling questions. Once all questions are answered, the system generates and displays the "Comprehensive Personalized Checklist of Data Elements." Checklist Streamlining Logic (Crucial): The checklist must combine all "Must-have data elements" with the relevant "Conditional data elements" (activated by a "Yes" answer in the wizard). De-duplication: If a data element is required by multiple frameworks (e.g., "Electricity Consumption" for ESG, DST, and Green Key), it must appear only once in the final list. Framework Mapping: For each data element, the list must clearly indicate all the frameworks it applies to. Frequency Consolidation: If a single data element has different collection frequencies across different frameworks (e.g., monthly for one, annually for another), the final checklist must adopt the most frequent cadence (monthly in this example). Module 4: Meter Management Automatic Meter Creation: Immediately after the personalizedChecklist is finalized in Module 3, the system must automatically create default meters for every metered data element required. Each of these auto-created meters will have its name attribute set to "Main" by default. Meter Management Interface: The user navigates to this screen and sees the pre-populated list of "Main" meters. The user must have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for meters. The user cannot delete a meter that has data associated with it. In such a case, they can deactivate it but not delelet it. The user can edit the default "Main" meters to add specific details. The user can add additional meters if they have more than one for a specific category (e.g., a second electricity meter). The user can activate/deactivate meters. Inactive meters will not appear in the Data Collection module. Meter Attributes: Every meter must have the following attributes: Type, Name, Account/Meter Number, Location Description, and Status (Active/Inactive). Module 5: Data Collection & Tracking Reporting Cycle: The user can select the reporting year. Month-Centric Navigation: The UI is organized by month. The user sees a selector for each month of the year. Current Year Logic: If the selected reporting year is the current year, the month selector must only show months from January up to the current month. Past Year Logic: If a past reporting year is selected, all 12 months must be shown. Navigation Buttons: "Previous Month" and "Next Month" buttons must be implemented. These buttons are disabled when the user is at the first or last available month in the selector. Unified Data Entry View: For the selected month, the system displays a single, unified list of all data collection tasks. This includes non-metered items and an individual entry for each active meter. Data Entry and Evidence: Each item in the list has an input field for its value and an interface to upload a supporting evidence file. Status Tracking: Each individual data entry row must have a visual status: Missing: No value entered and no evidence uploaded. Partial: Either a value is entered or evidence is uploaded, but not both. Complete: Both value and evidence are present. Progress Trackers: Overall Annual Progress: Two progress bars showing the completion percentage for the entire reporting year until today (one for data entry, one for evidence upload). Monthly Progress: Two dynamic progress bars showing the completion percentage for the currently selected month (one for data entry, one for evidence upload). Module 6: Dashboard Data-Driven Statistics: The dashboard must display key metrics derived from the user's setup and collected data, including: Total number of active frameworks. Total number of data elements on the personalized checklist. Total count of registered meters. Data Visualization: The dashboard must include charts that visualize the data entered in the Data Collection module (e.g., a bar chart showing monthly electricity consumption for the selected year).

Implementation Recommendations A. Data Collection Strategy Automated Collection: Implement automated meter reading for utilities (electricity, water) Centralized Repository: Create a single data repository to avoid duplication Standardized Templates: Use standardized templates for consistent data collection Integration: Integrate with existing property management systems B. Profiling Wizard Questions The onboarding profiling wizard should include these plain English questions: Basic Operations: "Do you have backup generators on-site?" "Do you own or operate company vehicles?" "Do you use LPG (liquid petroleum gas) in your operations?" "Do you have meeting rooms or event spaces available for hire?" "Do you have a restaurant, kitchen, or food service?" "Do you have outdoor spaces like gardens or lawns?" Sustainability Practices: "Do you use solar panels or other renewable energy sources?" "Do you have ISO 14001 or similar environmental certification?" "Is your company listed on any stock exchange?" C. Framework Mapping Each data element should be mapped to applicable frameworks to ensure comprehensive reporting: DST Requirements: Focus on operational metrics (energy, water, waste) Green Key: Emphasize environmental management and guest engagement ESG Reporting: Cover broader environmental, social, and governance aspects D. Data Validation Automated Validation: Set up automated checks for data completeness and accuracy Document Verification: Require supporting documents for all reported data Third-Party Verification: Consider third-party verification for critical metrics Audit Trail: Maintain complete audit trails for all data changes This comprehensive framework provides a solid foundation for your ESG app, ensuring that all mandatory and voluntary requirements are addressed while eliminating data duplication and streamlining the collection process for UAE hospitality sector SMEs.
